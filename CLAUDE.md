# Flow Kit

Minimal Google Flow API proxy: FastAPI + WebSocket server (`agent/`) + Chrome
extension (`extension/`). No local DB, no queue, no skills — a pure relay to the
Google Flow API via the extension.

Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8100`

## Pre-flight

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/health
# Must return: {"status":"ok", "extension_connected": true, ...}
```

## Run

```bash
python -m agent.main   # HTTP on :8100, extension WebSocket on :9222
```

## Layout

- `agent/main.py` — app entry, extension WebSocket, `/health`, `/api/ext/callback`
- `agent/api/flow.py` — all `/api/flow/*` endpoints
- `agent/api/tts.py` — `/api/tts/*` proxy to the OmniVoice server on Google Colab
  (set the rotating Colab URL via `PUT /api/tts/config` or `OMNIVOICE_BASE_URL`)
- `agent/services/flow_client.py` — relays requests to the extension over WS
- `agent/services/headers.py` — randomized headers
- `agent/config.py`, `agent/models.json` — endpoints + model keys
- `extension/` — Chrome MV3 extension (token capture, reCAPTCHA, Flow calls)

## Notes

- `media_id` is always UUID format (`xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`), never `CAMS...`
- The agent holds no state; all generation goes through the connected extension.
  If `extension_connected: false`, open Google Flow in Chrome with the extension loaded.
- See [README.md](README.md) for the full endpoint table.
